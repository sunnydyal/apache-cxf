### Libraries

| Library Name        | Short Description           | Documentation | Version |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `Apache CXF` | Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS or JBI. | [Documentation](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/index.html) | [Maven](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/using-cxf-with-maven.html) |
| `Spring Framework` | The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments. | [Documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/) | [Demos](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) |
| `Apache Maven` | Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. | [Documentation](http://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html) | 3.x |
